# {{project}} — SWARM Configuration

## Team Conventions

- **Runtime:** Bun
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Linter / Formatter:** Biome

## Agent Roles

| Agent | Role | Focus Area |
|-------|------|------------|
| backend-dev | Backend Developer | APIs, services, data layer |
| frontend-dev | Frontend Developer | UI components, pages, UX |
| qa-engineer | QA Engineer | Testing, verification, quality |
| architect | Architect | System design, patterns, ADRs |
| tech-writer | Tech Writer | Documentation, guides, changelogs |
| devops | DevOps Engineer | CI/CD, infrastructure, deployment |

## Story Lifecycle

```
draft → ideating → planned → executing → verifying → done → archived
                ↘                                   ↗
              awaiting_input ──────────────────────┘
```

Each phase is executed by the corresponding SWARM skill:
1. `swarm-ideate` — Problem decomposition & acceptance criteria
2. `swarm-plan` — Task breakdown & agent assignment
3. `swarm-execute` — Implementation with agent coordination
4. `swarm-verify` — Automated & manual verification
5. `swarm-close` — Retrospective, knowledge extraction, archival
